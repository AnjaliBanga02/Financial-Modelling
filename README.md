# Financial-Modelling
Financial modeling is the process of creating a mathematical representation of a real-world financial situation to forecast the financial performance of a company, project, or investment. It involves analyzing historical data, making assumptions, and applying formulas to project future financial outcomes.

This repository contains the financial modeling of Tata Steel, created for practice purposes. Please note that the amounts used in this model are assumptive and do not reflect the actual financials of Tata Steel.

As a beginner in financial modeling, this project helped me understand various critical parameters and techniques. One of the key learnings was minimizing hardcoded inputs to ensure the model's accuracy and adaptability for future use. To achieve this, I emphasized using dynamic formulas wherever possible, reducing the dependency on static values.

In this model, I followed best practices for financial modeling by:

- Using blue font color for hardcoded values to distinguish them clearly.
- Using black font color for dynamic calculations to highlight formula-driven data.
- This project allowed me to explore fundamental financial modeling formulas and concepts while gaining hands-on experience in creating dynamic and efficient models.
